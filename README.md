# AnimalTastic
This week's homework will be based on making buttons using jquery and using giffy api to incoperate into the homework through ajax. It will be interesting and I currently have a theme in mind.

I decided to make an animal theme and incorperated some css3 to the buttons and a more playful look for the site.
